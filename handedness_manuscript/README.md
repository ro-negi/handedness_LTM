The handedness_manuscript folder contains both the current working manuscript and a complete archive of all previous drafts. The Current_Version folder holds the most recent, actively edited version of the manuscript, so anyone looking for the latest text should start there. All earlier drafts are organized inside the Version_History folder, which is further divided by manuscript section. The Intro subfolder contains every previous version of the Introduction—including bullet-point outlines, partial drafts, and full revisions—while the Results subfolder stores earlier analyses and narrative drafts of the Results section. This structure makes it easy to track how each part of the manuscript has developed over time and to retrieve any earlier material when needed.
