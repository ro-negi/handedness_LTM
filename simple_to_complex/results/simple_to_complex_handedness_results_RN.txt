Description - 

We studied how the likelihood of handedness (hand preference) change from simple to complex tasks. 

Mathematical operations - 

Handedness index = Coefficient of variation (cv) 

cv = standard dev/abs. mean 

variance of proportions (v) = (probability of using right hand * probability of using left hand) / total number of events 

standard dev = √v

mean = (right hand - left hand)/total number of events


Statistical analysis: Repeated Measures Correlation 

We computed a correlation between task complexity (gutt score) and handedness index.
